# Flatdango App
 This application allows the user to view a list of movies, their title, runtime,
 showtime and available tickets. When the page loads, the first movie is shown.
 The app also allows the user to buy tickets to the movie by clicking the buy tickets button. Navigating from movie to movie can be done by clicking on a movie title on the list of movies on the left side of the page. When all the tickets for a movie are sold out the text in the buy tickets button changes to tickets sold out.
